If you're reading this in 2019, there isn't much here yet. I have just 
created this github-hosted website a couple of days ago. I was looking for a
quick and easy way to create simple posts where I could share ideas. Medium 
as a platform sounded interesting, but I don't quite like their paywall approach. 

Instead, I'll just self-publish posts, loosely related to programming, research, 
productivity or whatever else I find worth sharing.
