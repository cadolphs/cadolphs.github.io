title: Advent of Code 2019
---
I'm participating again in this year's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2019). 

I enjoy this coding challenge as the problems are usually small enough to be solved 
without too much boilerplate and overhead, but tricky enough to really make you think.

This year, I am trying out to use rather strict Test Driven Development (TDD) principles 
to arrive at clean code and clean design for the solutions. My attempts are shared 
on [GitHub](https://github.com/cadolphs/advent_of_code_2019).
