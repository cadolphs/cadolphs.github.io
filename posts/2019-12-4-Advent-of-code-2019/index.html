        <p>I'm participating again in this year's <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2019">Advent of Code</a>.</p>
<p>I enjoy this coding challenge as the problems are usually small enough to be solved
without too much boilerplate and overhead, but tricky enough to really make you think.</p>
<p>This year, I am trying out to use rather strict Test Driven Development (TDD) principles
to arrive at clean code and clean design for the solutions. My attempts are shared
on <a href="https://github.com/cadolphs/advent_of_code_2019">GitHub</a>.</p>
